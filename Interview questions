1. what is the use of shebang
2.why pipe is not working in below command
     date | echo " today is "
     expected : today is <output from date>>
     actual : today is 
Reason: DATE is a system utility command and it send its output to stdin so that pipe could not able to recieve this output.
3. Usage of AWK command utility 
    eg : ps -ef | grep "ubuntu" | awk -F " " '{print $2}'  # to print the pid of ubuntu proccess.
4. Adding the set commands inside a script 
     1. set -x   # run in debug mode
     2. set -e   # exists the script  when there is an error # it will not work for pipe "|"
     3. set -0 pipefail   # to exis the script if pipe fails.
