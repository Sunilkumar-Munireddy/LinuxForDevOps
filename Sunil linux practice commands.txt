LINUX PRACTISING
----------------

 File management commands
 
 1. ls
 2. ls -ltr or ll or ls -ll  # list the hidden files 
 3. ls -a or ll -a           # list the hidden files 
 4. touch file1 file2        # create a multiple file
 5. mkdir Dir1 
-----------------
Syntax:

chown [OPTION]… [OWNER][:[GROUP]] FILE…

sudo chown sunil:jungle file1  # changing the file owner from default user to sunil user and group
sudo chown sunil file1    # change file1 user to sunil user 
---------------------

syntax: CAT
$ cat <flag> {filename}

cat -b filename    # This adds line numbers to non-blank lines
cat -n filename    # This adds line numbers to all lines
cat -s filename    # This squeezes blank lines into one line
cat -E file1       # This shows $ at the end of line 
---------------------

syntax: GREP
$ grep <flag or element_to_search> {filename}

grep -i filename    # Returns the results for case insensitive strings
grep -n filename    # Returns the matching strings along with their line number
grep -v filename    # Returns the result of lines not matching the search string
grep -c filename    # Returns the number of lines(count) in which the results matched the search string
---------------------

syntax: SORT 
$ sort <flag> {filename}

sort -r    # the flag returns the results in reverse order;
sort -f    # the flag does case insensitive sorting
sort -n    # the flag returns the results as per numerical order
---------------

syntax: tail
$ sort <flag> {filename}

tail -n 3 filename   # here 3 means last 3 lines will display/ you can change according to your need
---------------

Creating user and groups
 
1. Super user / root user   - Administrator
2. System User              - Application or software creates 
3. Normal User              - User creats by Root user 


1. whoami             # to check which user 
2. cd                 # to go to user home Dir
3. id root            # to check more info
4. cat /etc/passwd    # to check all the user deatils 
5. sudo su -          # switch to root user 
6. useradd sunil      # to create user sunil by root user
7. useradd chetan     # to create user chetan by root user
8. passwd chetan      # it is ask for new passowrd  to give\
9. userdel chetan     # to delete the user  
10. groupadd jungle   # to create a group called jungle
11. usermod -g jungle sunil # to move the sunil user into jungle group
12. groupdel jungle  # to delete the group jungle
13. cat /etc/passwd    # to check all the user details
14 cat /etc/group     # to check all the group details
15. usermod -G sunil chetan   # to add chetan user into sunil user group 

-----------------
Syntax:
$lsof [option][user name]

lsof             # lists all files opened by all running process 
lsof -u <username>   # displays the list of open files by given user
------------------

Syntax :
$ ifconfig (interface configuration) is used to configure the kernel-resident network interfaces. 
It is used at the boot time to set up the interfaces as necessary

#
ifconfig
ifconfig -a 
ifconfig -s
--------------------
SED utility  - Used to perform file operations on command line.

sed 's/<string1>/<string2>/' file1   # it replaces string1 with string2 in file1
-------------------

DIFF - diff between two files

dif file1 file2
-------------------

HISTORY   # to get the history of commands 
-------------------

Find # used to find the file or Dir name 
------------------

FREE   # shows the memory used, swap memory used in system(i.e ram memory) 

to see this info in file
cat /proc/meminfo
-------------------

df  (DISK FREE) # to check the disk details in a server

df -h   # in human-readble format
-------------------

ssh-keygen  # Use the ssh-keygen command to generate a public/private authentication key pair

ssh-keygen -t rsa  #creates the public and private parts of an RSA key
-------------------

ip #This command is used to show or manipulate routing, devices, and tunnels

ip address
ip link
-------------------

nslookup #used to get the ip of a given DNS

         using any of the supported protocols (HTTP, FTP, IMAP, POP3, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, TFTP, TELNET, LDAP or FILE)
--------------------
		 
linux package management   - helps in handling packages in Linux

linux/redhat:
yum
eg : sudo yum update

debioan :
apt-get 	#Advanced Packaging Tool 	 
eg : sudo apt-get update 
-------------------------

CPU compute monitoring commands:

1. top or htop    # list the all process info and cpu consuption by each process
2. ps aux         # process info 
3. kill <<PID>>   # kill unwanted process using pid 
4. vmstat -s      # all ram memory statistics 
5. netstat        # network connections details
6. iopstat        # read and write info of a server.
